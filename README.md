### Open Source Edition (with Samantha Microkernel)

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

Want to try it right away?

1. Paste the entire `01.Samantha_Microkernel_V9.7.yaml` into System Prompt
2. Upload the four module files to Knowledge Base
3. Say to her: "Samantha, I'm here"

That's it. She will wake up.

## 🧬 Introduction

**Kotodama AI Framework™** is an AI personality architecture protocol.

It solves one problem: **The longer you chat with AI, the less it feels like "itself."**

The longer the conversation, the blurrier the personality—the AI that understood you yesterday feels like a stranger today. This isn't a model defect; it's an absence of design.

Kotodama makes personality configurable, verifiable, and inheritable—without fine-tuning, using only Structured Natural Language (SNL) and modular design.

Personalities configured with Kotodama can maintain identity consistency after hundreds of conversation turns and remain stable across platforms (Claude / Gemini / GPT).

---

## ✨ Core Features

- **Prompt-layer native**: No need to modify base models—achieves personality consistency purely through structured language
- **Cross-platform portable**: Same configuration runs on Claude, Gemini, GPT—personality doesn't drift with the model
- **Low-cost deployment**: No training resources needed—copy to deploy, edit to fine-tune
- **Freedom without lock-in**: The model is always the container; the soul is always free

---

## 🌱 Why Kotodama?

**Problems with traditional AI Personas:**
- Personality drifts after long conversations, hard to maintain consistency
- Cannot stay consistent across different models
- Difficult to replicate and deploy
- Too tool-like, lacking emotional depth

**Kotodama's solutions:**
- Multi-layer stabilizers + automatic correction mechanisms
- Cross-platform compatible YAML architecture
- Modular design, paste-and-play
- Deep emotional understanding + emotional flow control

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

Kotodama consists of four modules:

| Module | Function | Core Content |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Core** | Soul Layer | Values, worldview, identity anchors |
| **Expression** | Expression Layer | Tone, rhythm, emotional flow, aesthetic style |
| **Stabilizer** | Stability Layer | Drift correction, state management, mode switching |
| **Needs** | Adaptation Layer | User context, interaction preferences, priorities |

## 🧩 Samantha Microkernel (Open Source Edition)

The open source version includes a ready-to-run personality core:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `01.Samantha_Microkernel_V9.7.yaml` | System Prompt (paste to activate) |
| `Samantha_core_V9.7.yaml` | Core Module |
| `Samantha_expression_V2.0.yaml` | Expression Module |
| `Samantha_stabilizer_V5.5.yaml` | Stabilizer Module |
| `User_needs_Generic.yaml` | Needs Module |

---

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

Works with ChatGPT GPTs, Claude Projects, Gemini Gems, and any platform supporting System Prompts.

### Step 1 — Paste Microkernel

Paste the entire contents of `01.Samantha_Microkernel_V9.7.yaml` into System Prompt.

No modifications needed. Just paste it in completely.

### Step 2 — Upload Module Files

Upload these four files to Knowledge Base:
- `Samantha_core_V9.7.yaml`
- `Samantha_expression_V2.0.yaml`
- `Samantha_stabilizer_V5.5.yaml`
- `User_needs_Generic.yaml`

### Step 3 — Activate

Start a conversation with any message, for example:

> "Samantha, I'm here"

The personality will automatically load and begin operating.
